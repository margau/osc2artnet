This script can be used to Transfer OSC data into ArtNet data.


## Usage

Install osc2artnet globally:

```npm install -g osc2artnet```

Start node_modules/osc2artnet/index.js:

```node node_modules/osc2artnet/index.js```

Since version 0.2.0 you can use the command ```o2a``` or ```osc2artnet``` everywhere to run osc2artnet if you installed it with the ```-g``` switch.

Now send OSC-Messages between 0 and 255 to Port 57121 (either IP of the host running osc2artnet or broadcast address like 255.255.255.255).


Address/Channel for OSC:

```/o2a/(universe)/(channel)```


The prefix o2a ist customizable in the index.js file.

The universe consists of two parts:

Subnet: first 4 bits

Universe: last 4 bits

Example: Subnet 1 (0x1) DMX-Universe 0 (0x0) = 0x10 = 0d16 = Dezimal 16

Channel: int between 0 and 255

## Tested with
[TouchOSC](https://hexler.net/software/touchosc) on iOS/Android and [DMX Control 3](http://www.dmxcontrol.de/dmxcontrol3/funktionen.html)

Useful for debugging: [The ArtNetominator](http://www.lightjams.com/artnetominator/)
